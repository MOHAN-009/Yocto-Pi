  1. Initialised environment `source oe-init-build-env`.
  2. Created a directory at the poky level `../../sources`.
  3. Made changes to local.conf:

       DL_DIR ?= "${SOURCES}/downloads"
       SSTATE_DIR ?= "${SOURCES}/sstate-cache"
       TMPDIR = "${SOURCES}/tmp"
     - Set `RM_OLD_IMAGE = "1"`(Removes old image before building new image) and `INHERIT += "rm_work"`(Removes unnessaray files from tmp/work/.. to save space).
   4. Built image using - `bibake core-image-full-cmdline`

## üìÇ Output
