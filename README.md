# Yocto-Pi 🚀

This repository documents my step-by-step **Yocto Project journey**,  
where I build custom Linux images for QEMU (and later Raspberry Pi).  

Each numbered folder contains one stage of the journey, with logs, screenshots,  
and configuration files. This serves as both my learning diary and a resource for others starting with Yocto.
